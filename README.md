# Trojan
A Trojan code is a type of malicious software (malware) that is designed to deceive users by pretending to be a harmless or useful program. Once a Trojan is installed on a computer, it can perform a variety of malicious actions, such as stealing sensitive information, downloading additional malware, or giving a hacker remote access to the compromised system.

Studying Trojan code is important for cybersecurity students for several reasons. First, Trojans are one of the most common types of malware and can cause significant damage to both individuals and organizations. By understanding how Trojans work and how they are distributed, students can develop effective strategies for preventing and detecting these types of attacks.

Second, studying Trojan code can help students develop skills in malware analysis and reverse engineering. By examining the code of a Trojan, students can gain insight into the techniques used by attackers, as well as identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited to prevent or mitigate future attacks.
